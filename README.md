# SQLInjection

This project will show you the vulnerability of the site by presenting the sql injection.

SQL injection is a type of security exploit in which the attacker adds Structured Query Language (SQL) code to a Web form input box to gain access to resources or make changes to data.
An SQL query is a request for some action to be performed on a database.
Typically, on a Web form for user authentication, when a user enters their name and password into the text boxes provided for them, those values are inserted into a SELECT query.
If the values entered are found as expected, the user is allowed access.
if they aren’t found, access is denied. [Nevon](https://nevonprojects.com/sql-injection-prevention/)


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be
